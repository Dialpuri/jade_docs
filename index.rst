The Joint Academic Data Science Endeavour (JADE) is the largest GPU facility in the UK supporting world-leading research in machine learning. The computational hub will harness the capabilities of the NVIDIA DGX-1 Deep Learning System and comprise of 22 servers, each containing 8 of the newest NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs linked by NVIDIA's NV link interconnect technology. The new JADE facility aims to address the gap between university systems and access to national HPC services. This will drive forward innovation in machine learning, identifying new applications and insights in to research challenges.

This is the documentation for Joint Academic Data Science Endeavour (JADE) High Performance Computing (HPC) facility.
Run by Research Software Engineering' Research Computing Group with additional support from the Research Software Engineering team in Computer Science, they support the computational needs of hundreds of researchers across all departments.
